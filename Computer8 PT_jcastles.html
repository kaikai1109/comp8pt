<p style="font-size:15px; font-family:papyrus;text-align:justify;"> J Castles is like the Philippine's version of Disneyland! It is filled with amazing exhibits and spots that you can enjoy like rooms with laser shows, projections, flooded rooms, a light show, a theater, a playground and especially a large castle! <br>There are also a few rides but some are not yet operational. We had a chance to try their carousel and we had a lot of fun!. <br> There are plenty of places where you can take your selfies and pictures with your family and friends. <br>Of course we couldn't forget the food stalls, selling snacks such as churros, waffles, french fries and more! There's also a restaurant that sells Blue Burgers, some drinks and other meals, but unfortunately it was already sold-out. You can just imagine how good it was.<br> Our experience in the J Castle was already magical and we cannot imagine how good it will be once the place is already complete and operational. We hope we could go back and enjoy all of these again. </p>
